							<p class="mb-5 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".4s" style="visibility: visible; animation-delay: 0.4s; animation-name: fadeInUp; text-align: left;">
                                Our journey of building Bloom, an app designed to simplify and enhance the way roommates manage their shared responsibilities, has been challenging and enlightening. From creating the idea to making finishing touches, each step has brought its own set of lessons about designing for real user needs. We hope to share the lessons we've learned along our journey by reflecting on our insights gained from user research, prototyping, and development.
                            </p>
							
							<h1 class="mb-25 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".2s" style="visibility: visible; animation-delay: 0.2s; animation-name: fadeInUp;">Understanding User Needs</h1>
							<p class="mb-5 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".4s" style="visibility: visible; animation-delay: 0.4s; animation-name: fadeInUp; text-align: left;">
								Before writing a single line of code, our first step was to identify a target user group and determine their pain points. We decided to focus on roommates because each of us have roommates and, from our personal experiences, we know that maintaining a household is quite difficult and there are very few solutions built for it. Once we narrowed our focus to roommates, we conducted user research through interviews.
								<br><br>
								Before conducting interviews, we created a list of questions aimed at understanding how households are managed. These questions included: “can you describe a recent situation where technology played a role in your household management?” and “how do you currently divide and track household responsibilities?”
								<br><br>
								We found that the most effective questions were ones that were open ended questions and invited storytelling. When we asked users questions, such as “what are the main challenges you face in managing your household with roommates?” or “what are the most common household tasks/or things that require communication with your roommates?” we found ourselves with very similar “bullet-point” like answers that did not really reveal much about our user segment. Although we got a sense of how they perceive roommate communication and household management, we didn't learn about how they felt about it.
								<br><br>
								The way they felt was key. User 2 in our interview told us a story about how her living room was extremely dirty. She tried cleaning for 3 days but no one else showed up to help out or even mentioned it despite her messaging her group chat. She felt
							</p>
							<h3 class="mb-5 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".4s" style="visibility: visible; animation-delay: 0.4s; animation-name: fadeInUp;">“frustrated, ignored, and undervalued as a roommate.”</h3>
							<p class="mb-5 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".4s" style="visibility: visible; animation-delay: 0.4s; animation-name: fadeInUp; text-align: left;">
								Hearing about User 2’s personal experiences taking care of her home highlighted the emotional impact of poorly managed household chores and underscored the need for a solution that not only organizes tasks but also fosters a supportive community atmosphere among roommates.
								<br><br>
								From User 2’s interview and several more, our idea sparked: a collaborative chore coordinator designed to keep roommates accountable for their household tasks. We brainstormed alternative solutions on the market - productivity apps, shared calendars, and something as simple as a text group chat - and found that there was a need for innovation in the space. No existing solution was tailored to roommate groups nor oriented around community or accountability. Text group chat was by far the most common way of communicating but even our users complained about ignored messages, lost messages, and inefficiencies.

							<p class="mb-5 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".4s" style="visibility: visible; animation-delay: 0.4s; animation-name: fadeInUp; text-align: left;">
                                Armed with these insights, we moved into the prototyping stage. Our goal was to create a physical minimum viable product that could be tested with real users. We developed two simple paper prototypes that allowed roommates to list chores, assign them, and mark them as completed. In version 1, a round progress bar would indicate the user’s task completion rate. In version 2, a plant would grow to a height representing the user’s task completion rate. At first, we did not know which version would appeal to our users more. On one hand, version 1 is much straightforward and simple which aligns well with the busy nature of college students. However, version 2 since it is more fun and promotes greater collaboration since the garden is shared amongst roommates.
                            </p>

								<br>The initial feedback was promising, but mixed. User 1 preferred prototype #1 as he felt that plants did not provide a “numerical value” to indicate progress. He felt that numbers were important to incentivize roommates to contribute and keep them accountable. We received opposing feedback from User 2 who said he preferred prototype #2 as it created a more “community feel” and prototype #1 felt too impersonal.
								<br><br>
								We learned throughout our interviews that users will always have differing feedback due to their personal preferences. The key, however, is to incorporate both sides of the story in order to craft a “goldilocks” solution. From our interviews, we decided to choose prototype #2 for its “community feel” and to iterate by creating an option where users can see progress via plant growth, percentages, and a leaderboard all in one. That way, we could strike a balance between clear, quantifiable numbers and a pleasant, friendly interface.

							<p class="mb-5 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".4s" style="visibility: visible; animation-delay: 0.4s; animation-name: fadeInUp; text-align: left;">
                                We progressed with our design by building a Figma prototype which took into account all the feedback we received from our paper prototype:
                            </p>

							<p class="mb-5 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".4s" style="visibility: visible; animation-delay: 0.4s; animation-name: fadeInUp; text-align: left;">
                                We incorporated all the core elements from our paper prototype - garden theme, scheduling tasks, marking/completing tasks, viewing progress - into a high fidelity mobile app design. In our heuristic evaluations, we learned important lessons regarding visibility, saliency, and simplicity. Evaluators A and B indicated that it was confusing to navigate from my tasks to all tasks since the navigation arrows had low visibility. Evaluator B also mentioned that “Total: 25%” was confusing because it’s unclear who the percentage refers to. This violated heuristic #2 (match between he system and the real world) and #4 (consistency and standards) so we changed the wording to read “Group: 25%.” Although a smaller issue, evaluator C did not like the “Schedule” page due to the white-on-black text and the calendar graphic. The prototype design decision violated heuristic #3 (aesthetic design) and VDP #3 (typography).
								<br><br>Many lessons were learned from our evaluation that let us make changes almost immediately. We changed the colors on the schedule page to make it more readable; we changed the text to read “Group: 25” on the leaderboard; we replaced the calendar graphic with a more fitting one. Our final high fidelity prototype ended up looking like this:
                            </p>

                                Although we were all happy with this design, our journey was far from over. Throughout the next few weeks we spent countless hours building our design with react native and continued to refine and test it.

							<h1 class="mb-25 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".2s" style="visibility: visible; animation-delay: 0.2s; animation-name: fadeInUp;">User Testing and Final Adjustments</h1>
							<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".4s" style="visibility: visible; animation-delay: 0.4s; animation-name: fadeInUp; text-align: left;">
								Despite our new prototype, we discovered through our evaluations that it was still difficult for users to navigate between different task pages. We decided to implement a drop down picker and conducted several user tests to analyze its efficacy. We found that users ended up navigating through the task screens much quicker using the drop down picker, which indicated that it improved usability. From the experiment results, we decided to keep the arrow interface as well as the new drop down picker interface for switching pages.

							<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".4s" style="visibility: visible; animation-delay: 0.4s; animation-name: fadeInUp; text-align: left;">
								Although we intended to establish a community feel, we discovered through our TA evaluation that our app had potential to do the opposite. On the “all tasks'' page, roommates are pitted against each other which creates a hostile, competitive environment, not a collaborative one. Taking this feedback into consideration, we switched our design to a single group flower that grew collectively with all roommates completed tasks.

								Our evaluations and TA reviews taught us how detailed designing can get. Even something as simple as a task list has countless variations, and it’s very difficult to create an optimal one. When building our app with react-native, we had trouble striking a balance between usability/great design practices and efficiency. For instance, in our initial design, users simply checked tasks and they would show up as such. However, we received feedback saying to push completed tasks to the bottom. This seemed like such a small detail but had important implications on usability. 
								<br><br>
								We imagined a scenario where there were 50 tasks. If completed tasks remained at the top of the task list, it would be a huge pain for users to scroll through the tasks to find the one they wanted to check. In our final design, we implemented this change and it was incredibly satisfying.

								As designers, we had to be nitpicky for our users. Although small changes took us hours at a time to design and implement, they were necessary for creating the best user experience possible. We found it useful to divide up our work into design and engineering teams so one person could create a design and another could code it. That boosted efficiency and helped us divide up our work. This seems to be a common practice in the tech industry and we now understand why.

							<h1 class="mb-25 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".2s" style="visibility: visible; animation-delay: 0.2s; animation-name: fadeInUp;">Conclusions</h1>
							<p class="mb-5 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".4s" style="visibility: visible; animation-delay: 0.4s; animation-name: fadeInUp; text-align: left;">
                                We learned a plethora of lessons about design while developing bloom. The most valuable lesson we learned was to be user-centric. We often had to remind ourselves that as designers, our goal is to design for others, not just ourselves. We recognized the importance of conducting user interviews focused on real user stories and emotions and soliciting feedback from user tests.
								<br><br>
								From the frustrations of a dirty living room to the satisfaction of a well-coordinated home, each piece of feedback and every user story drove us to iterate our app one step at time. We learned that the process was a marathon, not a sprint. It would be impossible to design perfectly on the first try. Reaching the ideal solution required us to prototype and test continuously. We discovered that the perfect interface doesn’t come from having an “eye for design”; rather, it comes from having an “eye for the user” —being able to take their complaints and frustrations and translate them into design decisions that meet their needs.
